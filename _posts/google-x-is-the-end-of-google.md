A New York Times [article][1] mentioned augmented reality glasses from
Google and mentioned Google X. A similar [piece][2] 6 months earlier
discussed Google X in detail. All of Google used to be Google x with
employees twenty percent time, but now Google is more traditional in
their approach. Mention gmail. Have a disruptive research group and
have normal employees just do work.
